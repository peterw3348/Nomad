START Champion Classes ===
 
 Every champion in League of Legends has an assigned class, with a limited number also being considered in a secondary class. Classes and their interactions with one another influence gameplay pacing and decisions.

The available classes are as follows:

     Controller
         Enchanter
         Catcher
     Fighter
         Juggernaut
         Diver
     Mage
         Burst
         Battlemage
         Artillery
     Marksman
     Slayer
         Assassin
         Skirmisher
     Tank
         Vanguard
         Warden
     Specialist (or Unclassified)

END Champion Classes ===

START Definitions ===

Four distinct terms may be applied to champions when referring to playstyle:

    Class: A predefined set of patterns and capabilities that inherently stems from a champion's statistics' and spells' numbers (range, damage, duration, etc.)

    Attribute: A capability that a champion may have when compared to other characters in the game, which usually stems from their Class. For example:
        Being able to unleash devastating spells in a very short time frame defines "burst", whereas performing multiple rounds of damage defines "dps" (from "damage per second"); etc.
        Higher durability defines "tankiness", whereas lower durability defines "squishiness"
        Unusually long-range spells define "poke combat", whereas unusually low-range spells define "close combat"
        The presence of movement spells defines "mobility", their absence defines "immobility"
        and others.

    Role: The practical embodiment of a champion's attributes in a game at a given time. For example:
        An icon representing Caitlyn Caitlyn can perform a lot of poking during the earlier stages of the game in the laning phase, but can later upgrade to a nuker, due to An icon for Caitlyn's ability Headshot Headshot's and An icon for Caitlyn's ability Ace in the Hole Ace in the Hole's multipliers.
        An icon representing Kai'Sa Kai'Sa is a sustained damage carry when she buys  Marksman items, but can transform into a flanker by utilizing An icon for Kai'Sa's ability Killer Instinct Killer Instinct aggressively to pick off important enemies.
        An icon representing Malphite Malphite can assume the role of a frontliner, a champion that soaks up a lot of damage and disruption from the enemy team, or a team-wide burst champion, depending on his itemization.
        An icon representing Yasuo Yasuo can be a powerful duelist due to his mobility and spell combos, but he may also dive into teamfights with his An icon for Yasuo's ability Last Breath Last Breath.
        etc.

    Position: The usual or default location that a champion may start the game in, determined by the metagame rules and agreements at the time. Most commonly in  Summoner's Rift, there are currently 5 selectable positions within a drafted team:  Top,  Jungle,  Mid,  Bottom Carry,  Bottom Support, along with a 6th archaic  Roaming "position". Due to each position hosting a subset of all champions that have certain attributes, positions usually inherit certain roles that champions may sustainably have. Common combinations of positions and classes include: support enchanter or controller; botlane carry marksman or sustained-damage mage; midlane burst mage or slayer; Toplane tank or fighter; Jungler fighter or slayer.

START Interaction ===

Class diagram shows their typical properties, counterclasses, strengths and weaknesses

The classes' attributes and counter-play correlations can be summarized in a directed graph:

    Arrows are labelled with a key attribute.
    A class' attributes are described by its adjacent edges (the single preceding and the single succeeding arrow).
    A class' role counters are generally described by the two preceding classes.
    Controllers have a special position in the middle, because they are typically not designed to fight 1-on-1; however they are placed closest to tanks because tanks usually also present high controlling capabilities.

    Example: A Tank's characteristic properties are toughness (tankiness), control, and some sort of typically high-downtime mobility or gap closer. Tanks can easily deal with the burst from slayers and mages, but struggle against the sustained damage of fighters and marksmen.

The mutual counterability of all classes naturally leads to class diversity in gameplay, as balance dictates that a superclass cannot exist that dominates all others. Every competitive team—especially in higher levels of play—is thus incentivized to build up and distribute its team composition with these classes in mind.

If this is not the case, as it often happens in non-competitive or recreational games (for example a team chooses to set up a heavy assassin composition), the game result can be determined by an enemy adapting and deploying the dominant class' natural weakness by picking them as a response during drafting and/or by choosing proper items and summoner spells to do so. Hence, understanding and adapting to these inter-class relations is an advantageous skill to have as a player.

END Interaction ===

START Other Attributes ===

While unofficial, the following attributes are often still used to describe and classify champions, even by members of Riot Games:

    Bully: A champion that has either exceptional range or exceptional strength during laning that they can utilize to seriously threaten, or bully, their opponents and force them to play defensively. Typically, this term describes champions who can harass or engage on their opponents during the early stages of the game with relatively little fear of retribution. Hallmarks of bully champions include ones that are given very high base statistics, especially health and attack damage; cheap, long-ranged damaging spells; and mobility that increases with nearby units. Most bullies tend to be fighters, who often present several or even all of these features, but members of other classes may also qualify as bullies.

    Carry: A champion who becomes powerful enough in damage as a match progresses so as to be able to seemingly win games single-handedly, thereby "carrying" the rest of the team on their back.
        Hypercarry: A more extreme version of a carry, a hypercarry is a champion whose late-game strength is assumed to be so powerful that they eventually eclipse any other non-hypercarry in power.

    Damage-dealer: A champion who has the means to deal a larger share of the team's damage to enemy champions in a shorter amount of time during fights, in a vacuum. This definition excludes Tank- and Controller-Class champions, since due to their innate attributes they require significantly more time to deal the same amount of damage that damage dealers can ideally put out.
        Primary damage-type dealer: A champion specialization based on which damage type—physical or magic—they deal most, sometimes exclusively one or the other. This is relevant for team composition, as a team that skews toward either type of damage dealt on their carries can be more effectively countered by armor or magic resistance, respectively. The terms "Attack Damage Carry" and "Ability Power Carry" derive from this definition, as traditionally attack damage scales physical damage and ability power scales magic damage, although in modern usage the terms are synonymous with certain classes.

    Jungler: A champion who can successfully thrive on the jungle's resources. While more of a position, the jungler attribute is dependent on certain champion characteristics, such as innate durability, sustained early damage, self-healing, mobility, burst, crowd control. Not all of these traits are required, but all successful junglers possess several of them.

    Pusher: A champion who is effective in both waveclearing and taking down  turrets, thereby "pushing" their lane towards enemy structures and enabling their destruction. Pushers typically have area of effect damage, rapid attacks or abilities that are also able to target turrets, and occasionally, pets.

END Other Attributes ===

START A0 Controller ===

Controllers assist their allies with potent utility and keep enemies at bay with crowd control. Weak when alone, supports are capable of massively amplifying their teammates' power to become the strongest class in group combat (or teamfights), supplying crucial utility or crowd control at clutch moments to save allies from death and enable takedowns on the enemy team.

Supports are less dependent on items to function well, but over time their contribution expands as they lend aid to their entire team with both their spells and effective, yet affordable, items. Sub-classes of Controllers are enchanters and catchers. 

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 2
}

END A0 Controller ===

START A1 Catchers ===

Catchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down. 

Strengths
Ranged crowd control, Disengage, Lock down

Weaknesses
Damage, Durability

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 2
}

END A1 Catchers ===

START A2 Enchanters ===

Enchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others. 

Strengths
Healing, Shielding, Range

Weaknesses
Damage, Durability, Mobility

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 2
}

END A2 Enchanters ===

START B0 Fighter ===

Fighters (also known as Bruisers) are a diverse group of short-ranged combatants who excel at both dealing and surviving damage. With easy access to heavy, continuous damage (or DPS) and a host of innate defenses, fighters thrive in extended fights as they seek out enemies to take down, but their limited range puts them at constant risk of being kept at bay (or kited) by their opponents via crowd control, range and mobility.

Fighters tend to have an advantage against assassins, whose burst tends to fall short of killing them when unaided, as well as tanks, whose inferior damage allows fighters to eventually defeat them in duels, but often struggle against mages and marksmen, whose superior reach allows them to kite approaching fighters. Sub-classes of the Fighters are juggernauts, and divers. 

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 3,
    "Toughness": 3,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": -1
}

END B0 Fighter ===

START B1 Divers ===

Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked. 

Strengths
Damage, Mobility, Engage

Weaknesses
Range, Durability, Disengage

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 3,
    "Toughness": 3,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": -1
}

END B1 Divers ===

START B2 Juggernauts ===

Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility. 

Strengths
Damage, Durability, Survivability

Weaknesses
Range, Mobility, Disengage

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 3,
    "Toughness": 3,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": -1
}

END B2 Juggernauts ===

START C0 Mage ===

Mages are champions who typically possess great reach, ability-based area of effect damage and crowd control, and who use all of these strengths in tandem with each other to trap and destroy enemies from a distance. Specializing in magic damage, often burst damage, and therefore investing heavily in items that allow them to cast stronger and faster spells, mages excel at chaining their abilities together in powerful combos in order to win fights, though their abilities also tend to be difficult to land and can be mitigated, if not avoided completely, by their targets if they react in time.

Though mages typically tend to focus on killing prime targets in combat, they can also fall back to their innate crowd control and utility to manipulate key opponents, protecting their team from them or setting them up for a takedown, and in the right circumstances can damage and control multiple enemies at a time. In spite of the influence they exert, mages tend to be innately fragile, and fall quickly to direct strikes.

In general, mages are capable of dealing well with marksmen, as their burst can kill them before they can return the same amount of damage, and fighters, as their crowd control tends to make them excellent kiters. However, they are easily shut down by assassins who can often bypass their reach and spells completely, and tanks, who can lock them down and soak up their abilities better than other classes. Sub-classes of Mages are burst, battle, and artillery Mages. 

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": -1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 0
}

END C0 Mage ===

START C1 Artillery ===

Artillery Mages are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances. In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them, due to their extreme fragility and limited mobility. 

Strengths
Range, Damage

Weaknesses
Enemy divers, Tanks, Sustain

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": -1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 0
}

END C1 Artillery ===

START C2 Battlemages ===

Battlemages (also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time. 

Strengths
Damage, Crowd control, Survivability

Weaknesses
Range, Tanks, Cooldowns

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": -1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 0
}

END C2 Battlemages ===

START C3 Burst ===

Burst Mages aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver. 

Strengths
Damage, Range, Crowd control

Weaknesses
Cooldowns, Enemy Frontline, Range

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": -1,
    "Control": 2,
    "Mobility": 0,
    "Utility": 0
}

END C3 Burst ===

START D0 Marksmen ===

Marksmen are ranged champions whose power almost exclusively revolves around their basic attacks: using their reach to land massive continuous damage from a distance, marksmen are capable of taking down even the toughest of opponents when positioned behind the safety of their team, and excel at securing map objectives such as turrets, inhibitors and the nexus. Marksmen are tremendously vulnerable to burst damage, due to their fragility, and tend to be exceptionally weak early in the game, requiring high amounts of gold, mostly via minion kills (or CS: Creep Score) to acquire powerful, but expensive, damage-focused items. Due to their potent reach and DPS, marksmen are particularly strong against more durable opponents, namely fighters and tanks, but fall quickly to the burst damage of assassins and mages.

Strengths
Sustained Damage, Range

Weaknesses
Crowd control, Burst, Mobility

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 5,
    "Toughness": -2,
    "Control": 1,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": -1
}

END D0 Marksmen ===

START E0 Slayer ===

Slayers are highly mobile champions who specialize in single target burst damage. What they generally lack in resilience, they more than make up for with their ability to quickly cover large distances, kill priority targets and retreat just as fast. Epitomizing a high risk, high reward playstyle, assassins are natural opportunists and prefer to strike when their targets are alone and vulnerable, rather than engage them in a direct assault, favoring damage-oriented item builds to capitalize on their offensive capabilities. They're particularly effective against softer (or squishy) targets, especially mages and marksmen, but often struggle against the heightened defenses of fighters and tanks. Subclasses of Slayers are assassins and skirmishers. 

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 1,
    "Mobility": 3,
    "Utility": -1
}

END E0 Slayer ===

START E1 Assassins ===

Assassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage. 

Strengths
Damage, Mobility, Stealth

Weaknesses
Crowd control, Disengage, Shields, Tanks

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 1,
    "Mobility": 3,
    "Utility": -1
}

END E1 Assassins ===

START E2 Skirmishers ===

Skirmishers (also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets. 

Strengths
Damage, Hard to disengage, Survivability

Weaknesses
Target selection, Being focused, Range, Crowd control

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 4,
    "Toughness": 1,
    "Control": 1,
    "Mobility": 3,
    "Utility": -1
}

END E2 Skirmishers ===

START F0 Tank ===

Tanks are tough melee champions who sacrifice damage in exchange for powerful crowd control. While able to engage enemies in combat, a tank's purpose isn't usually to kill opponents; rather, tanks excel at disrupting enemies and diverting focus to themselves, allowing them to lock down specific targets (or several targets at once), as well as remove (or peel) threats from their allies.

In addition to strong base defenses, tanks generally have a means of amplifying their tankiness even further with their abilities, and tend to fully invest in defensive items to maximize their resilience. However, tanks lack the tools to truly succeed in single combat, and their influence is limited by their low overall mobility, preventing them from constantly staying on top of their targets.

As tanks can handle burst damage very well, they tend to succeed against assassins and most mages, but their vulnerability to continuous damage puts them at a disadvantage against fighters and marksmen. Subcategories of Tanks are vanguards, and wardens. 

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 4,
    "Control": 4,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": 0
}

END F0 Tank ===

START F1 Vanguards ===

Vanguards are offensive tanks. Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect. 

Strengths
Durability, Engage, Lock down

Weaknesses
Mobility, Disengage, Range

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 4,
    "Control": 4,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": 0
}

END F1 Vanguards ===

START F2 Wardens ===

Wardens are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray. 

Strengths
Durability, Ally Protection, Disengage

Weaknesses
Mobility, Damage Output

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 1,
    "Toughness": 4,
    "Control": 4,
    "Mobility": 1,
    "Utility": 0
}

END F2 Wardens ===

START G0 Specialist ===

Specialists are a diverse group of champions who do not "fit into a neat little box" in regards to other class/subclass specifications. The majority of these champions were once part of other sub-classes but were reclassified in the V7.10 update, including a large number of champions from the former Zoner subclass of Controller. As a consequence, many Specialists exhibit "zone control" either as a dominant or secondary attribute, including many of the pre-7.10 Specialists.

A Zone Controller is a champion whose influence is limited either to telegraphed zones—such as An icon for Azir's ability Arise! Azir's Soldiers and An icon for Zilean's ability Time Bomb Time Bomb—or a persistent threat that is dependent on cooldown knowledge—such as An icon for Cho'Gath's ability Feast Feast, An icon for Zilean's ability Chronoshift Chronoshift or An icon for Fiddlesticks's ability Crowstorm Crowstorm. The latter type of Zone Controller is comparable in their psychological threat to a Juggernaut, except that this threat largely diminishes once the problematic ability is known to be on cooldown. 

Strengths
Area control, High threat

Weaknesses
Displacements, Mobile enemies, Positioning

"Ratings": {
    "Damage": 3,
    "Toughness": 1,
