# Branching Standard

This document defines the branching standards to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

## **1. Main Branch**
- **`main`**: The stable, production-ready branch. All changes must be thoroughly tested and reviewed before being merged into `main`.

## **2. Feature and Maintenance Branches**
All development work must occur in dedicated branches before merging into `main`.

| Branch Type | Naming Convention | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Feature** | `feature/<name>` | For developing new features. Merged into `main`. |
| **Refactor** | `refactor/<name>` | For restructuring code without modifying functionality. Merged into `main`. |
| **Bug Fix** | `fix/<name>` | For resolving bugs before merging into `main`. |
| **CI/CD** | `ci/<name>` | For modifying CI/CD workflows and automation. Merged into `main`. |
| **Documentation** | `docs/<name>` | For improving documentation. Merged into `main`. |

## **3. Release & Hotfix Branches**
| Branch Type | Naming Convention | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Release** | `release/<version>` | Used to prepare a new release. Merged into `main` after testing. |
| **Hotfix** | `hotfix/<name>` | Used for urgent production bug fixes. Merged directly into `main`. |

## **4. Branching Rules**
- **All changes must be developed in a dedicated branch** and follow the naming convention.
- **Feature, fix, and refactor branches must be merged into `main`** after testing and review.
- **Release branches should be tested before merging into `main`**.
- **Hotfix branches should be created only for critical production issues** and merged directly into `main`.

## **5. Merge and Review Process**
- **Pull Requests (PRs) are required** for all merges into `main`.
- **Code reviews must be conducted before merging** to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **No direct commits to `main` are allowed**; all changes must go through a PR process.

## **6. Enforcement**
Automated tools and policies should be in place to enforce the branching strategy, including:
- **Branch protection rules** to prevent direct commits to `main`.
- **CI/CD validation checks** before merging.
- **Pre-commit hooks** to enforce naming conventions and commit standards.

This standard ensures a structured and maintainable workflow while preventing unnecessary conflicts and inconsistencies.
